#### 7.  IV plantdoc for notebook

Focus: Revision of airctic/icedata/notebooks/dev/plantdoc.ipynb to update codes, tutorial

Publication:  submitted for open-source PR, 2021 September

https://github.com/airctic/icedata/tree/master/notebooks/dev

#### 8.  IV plant git, custom parser, model

Focus: Using plantdoc, uploaded via git clone, custom parser and modelling using faster rcnn, yolov5, retinanet and efficientdet

Publication:  Medium, 2021 September

#### 9.  IV BCCD new

Focus: Using a revised BCCD dataset (better annotation), upload via git clone, voc parser, no explicit class_map, modelling (final with yolov5), callbacks, save.  (Fit_one_cycle not included-> placed in IV_in_the_works) 

Publication:  Medium, 2021 September

#### 10.  BCCD_Dataset for Notebook

Focus: BCCD Dataset for VOCBBoxParsing and modelling.  Based on IV BCCD new.  

Publication: submitted for open-source PR, 2021 September as airctic/icedata/notebooks/dev/bccd_rev

https://github.com/airctic/icedata/pulls

Branch path: notebooks/dev/bccd_dev.ipynb

#### 11 and 12.  IV wheat Kaggle works!! and _yolov5

Focus: Global wheat dataset, custom parsing and modelling (with extension via fit_one_cycle).

IV_wheat_kaggle_works!! shows custom parsing using 'source' as class.  Final model using Faster R-CNN.

IV_wheat_kaggle_yolov5 shows custom parsing with single class 'wheat'.  Final model using YOLOv5, mAP 0.46 after 40 epochs (still with room to increase,
but should be adequate for wheat head detection purposes).

#### 13.  custom_parser

Focus:  Simple custom Parser for a single-object type detection, based on wheat dataset.
